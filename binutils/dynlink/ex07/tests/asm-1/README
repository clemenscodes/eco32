This program shows that an ordinary executable cannot be executed
successfully at an arbitrary load address.

A pointer into the data segment is constructed in $1. The pointer
is then used to load the word 0x3456789A into the register $8.

runlo: This is perfectly OK if executed at the link address.
runhi: But it fails totally if executed at some other address.

This deficiency could be eliminated if there would be load-time
relocations in the code segment. But this would render the code
non-shareable, which is impractical for shared libraries.
