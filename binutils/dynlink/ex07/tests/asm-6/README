This test checks the sharing of a single GOT entry among references
to a global variable in a single module. The GOT should contain only
two pointers, although there are four references to variables in the
code; thus the .got segment should have a size of 2*4 = 0x08 bytes.
The .data segment should have a size of 5*4 = 0x14 bytes.

After running the program, the registers $8..$11 should contain the
following values:
$8   0x3456789A
$9   0x456789AB
$10  0x3456789A
$11  0x456789AB
