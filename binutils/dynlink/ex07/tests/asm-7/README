The executable is the result of linking two almost identical modules
(the function labels are different), each with references to a few
global variables, and a third module which defines the global variables.
The test checks that references to the same global variable in different
modules share the same GOT entry. The .got segment should have a size
of 2*4 = 0x08 bytes. The .data segment should have a size of 5*4 = 0x14
bytes.

After running the program, the registers $8..$11 should contain the
following values:
$8   0x3456789A
$9   0x456789AB
$10  0x3456789A
$11  0x456789AB
