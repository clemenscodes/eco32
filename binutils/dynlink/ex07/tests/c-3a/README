Here, the address of an external variable (its value is 0x3456789A)
is computed and stored in a local pointer variable. main() returns
the difference of the value we get when dereferencing the pointer
and the value we get when directly accessing the variable, which
of course must be 0. The compiler is told to produce PIC.

shows: Show the assembler output from the compiler.
showo: Show the object file with its relocations.
showx: Show the executable with its relocations.
runlo: Run the program at its link address.
runhi: Run the program at some location above its link address.
