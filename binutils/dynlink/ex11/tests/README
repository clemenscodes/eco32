Order of tests (with increasing difficulty)
-------------------------------------------

TestStaticLibs
    The executable is linked statically.
    It is compiled using non-PIC.
    The libraries are archives, produced by ar.
    They are compiled using non-PIC.

TestStaticPIC
    The executable is linked statically.
    It is compiled using PIC.
    The libraries are archives, produced by ar.
    They are compiled using PIC.

TestDynamicPIC
    The executable is linked dynamically.
    It is compiled using PIC.
    The libraries are shared objects, produced by ld.
    They are compiled using PIC.

TestFuncPtrs
    Same as TestDynamicPIC, but with function pointers
    in the "middle" library.

TestDataPtrs
    Same as TestDynamicPIC, but with data pointers
    in the "middle" library.

TestAbsSym
    Check that absolute symbols make it to the combined
    global symbol table. Show access to such a symbol.

TestDynamicLibs
    The executable is linked dynamically.
    It is compiled using non-PIC.
    The libraries are shared objects, produced by ld.
    They are compiled using PIC.
