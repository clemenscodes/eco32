This program shows the assembler realization for accessing static
data from PIC.

The following two pseudo-instructions are used:
.gotadr	<got>			load register <got> with the
				address of the GOT
.gotoff	<tgt>,<got>,<sym>	load register <tgt> with the
				address of symbol sym, using
				the GOT address register <got>

showo: Here you can explore how .gotadr and .gotoff are implemented.
showx: Here you can look at the resulting executable.
runlo: Run the program at its link address.
runhi: Run the program at some location above its link address.
