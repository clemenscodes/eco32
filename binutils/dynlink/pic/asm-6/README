This test checks the sharing of a single GOT entry among references
to a global variable. The GOT should contain only two pointers,
although there are four references to variables in the code; thus
the .got segment should have a size of 2*4 = 0x08 bytes. The .data
segment should have a size of 5*4 = 0x14 bytes.
