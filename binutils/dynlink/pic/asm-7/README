The executable is the result of linking two almost identical modules
(the function labels are different), each with references to a few
global variables, and a third module which defines the global variables.
The test checks that the references in different modules  share the same
GOT entry. The .got segment should have a size of 2*4 = 0x08 bytes. The
.data segment should have a size of 5*4 = 0x14 bytes.
