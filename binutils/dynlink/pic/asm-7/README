The executable is the result of linking two almost identical modules
(the function labels are different), each with some static variables.
The test checks that within a module the GOT entries to the same static
variables are shared, but the references in different modules don't
share the same GOT entry. The .got segment should have a size of 4*4 =
0x10 bytes. The .data segment should have a size of 10*4 = 0x28 bytes.
