This program shows that an ordinary executable cannot be
executed successfully at an arbitrary load address, even
when generated from C source.

In this little program, main() returns the value of a static
variable (its value is 0x3456789A).

runlo: This is perfectly OK if executed at the link address.
runhi: But it fails totally if executed at some other address.
